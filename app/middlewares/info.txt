## 🔍 Why You Can’t Use `Depends()` in Middleware

Here’s the key concept:

### ✅ FastAPI’s `Depends()` system only works **after** the middleware phase.

* Middleware is part of **Starlette’s lower-level request/response lifecycle**.
* `Depends()` is a **FastAPI feature** that only activates **inside routes** and **dependency functions** — not middleware.

That’s why this fails in middleware:

```python
def jwt_middleware(request: Request, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    ...
```

You’ll get an error like:
**"TypeError: jwt\_middleware() got an unexpected keyword argument 'db'"**

---

## ✅ So what do we do instead?

You **manually** do what `Depends(get_db)` would do:

```python
from db.setup import SessionLocal

db: Session = SessionLocal()
# ... use db
db.close()
```

It’s like **DIY dependency injection** — same result, just no FastAPI magic involved.

## 💡 TL;DR

| Concept              | Route/Dependency | Middleware      |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `Depends(get_db)`    | ✅ Yes            | ❌ Not supported |
| Manual DB session    | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes           |
| `request.state.user` | ✅ Common pattern | ✅ Yes           |

"""Great question — this line is doing something very handy and elegant in FastAPI:

```python
request.state.user = user
```

---

## 🧠 What is `request.state`?

`request.state` is a **shared place to store custom data** on the `Request` object during a request’s lifecycle.

* It's like attaching a temporary "sticky note" to the request.
* Anything you set on `request.state` in middleware (or elsewhere) is **available later** — e.g., in your route handlers or dependencies.

---

## ✅ Why do we use `request.state.user`?

Because after decoding the JWT and fetching the user from the DB in middleware, you want to **make that user accessible** downstream — without decoding the token again!

### 💡 Analogy:

Think of `request.state` like `req.user` in Express.js:

```js
req.user = userFromDB
```

Same thing here:

```python
request.state.user = userFromDB
```

---

## 📦 Example usage in a route

```python
from fastapi import Request

@app.get("/me")
async def get_profile(request: Request):
    user = request.state.user  # 🎯 grabbed from middleware
    return {"username": user.username, "email": user.email}
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature              | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `request.state`      | Temporary per-request storage           |
| `request.state.user` | Pass user info from middleware to route |
| Lifetime             | Valid **only for that request**         |
